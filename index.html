      <h1>Monsters and Why I Love Them</h1>
      <h2>Jane Plomp's Music Thesis</h2>
      <p>I began my music thesis with one guiding word: Monsters. Below are
        the results. </p>
      <p>Note: Some monsters on this list may be more lovable than others.</p>

      <h3>Siren</h3>

      </audio>
      <p>Sirens are typically representative of temptation and seduction. I
        wanted to explore what a sincere love would look like if your lover
        has a career in destroying people with her voice.</p>

      <h3>Clone-Me</h3>

        <source src="audio/Clone-Me.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
      </audio>
      <p>Sometimes I think it'd be nice to make a clone of myself
      who will do all my work. This song reminds me why that might
      be a bad idea.</p>

      <h3>Mothman</h3>
      <audio controls>
        <source src="audio/Mothman.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
      </audio>
      <p>Mothman is kinda hot... right?</p>

      <h3>The Swarm</h3>
      <audio controls>
        <source src="audio/The_Swarm.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
      </audio>
      <p>This is about bees. It's also about freedom and isolation, and how by
      making space in life for those who take advantage of you, you can lose
      your sense of self.</p>

      <h3>Frankly_Francine</h3>
      <audio controls>
        <source src="audio/Frankly_Francine.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
      </audio>
      <p>This song is sung from the perspective of Frankenstein's monster, in
      this adaptation a woman who calls herself "Francine" and dearly loves
      herself.</p>

      <h3>Nessie</h3>
      <audio controls>
        <source src="audio/Nessie.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
      </audio>
      <p>An instrumental piece. Although storytelling without lyrics is not
      my usual method, it was a fun challenge for this project.</p>

      <h3>Nice Guy</h3>
      <audio controls>
        <source src="audio/Nice_Guy.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
      </audio>
      <p>Nice Guys are the real monster. Please be forewarned there is some
      vulgar language and swearing in this song.</p>

      <h3>Pretty Brain</h3>
      <audio controls>
        <source src="audio/Pretty_Brain.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
      </audio>
      <p>My neuroscience thesis involved music, so it felt appropriate that my
        music thesis get a little bit of brain action as well. I do not condone
         nor recommend the actions or opinions in this song.</p>

      <p>Thank you for listening.</p>
